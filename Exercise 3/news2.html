        <strong>
          MANILA - Presidential candidate Sen. Ronald "Bato" dela Rosa said he is willing to undergo a drug test
        </strong>
        should it be required for candidates in the 2022 elections.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dela Rosa, a former Philippine police chief, said it is only right that
        candidates undergo the said screening, since security guards are required to do the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Yes, dapat lang kasi yung security guard nga na iisang establisimiyento lamang ang binabantayan
        ay nire-require natin ng drug test, how about much more yung presidente na buong bansa
        ang binabantayan at buong bansa ang pinamumunuan," he explained in a video.
      </p>

      <p>
        (Security guards undergo the same screening for drug tests,
        how much more if you are running for president,
        where you guard the whole country)
      </p>

      <p>
        "So unfair 'no kung hindi pareho ang pag-treat natin sa dalawang klaseng posisyon na yan,
        so dapat magpa-drug test talaga," he pointed out.
      </p>

      <p>
        (It is unfair if we don't treat the two the same under the standard,
        so there should be a drug test)
      </p>

      <p>
        The lawmaker also backs medical tests for the candidates.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Ideally, maganda talaga dapat yan kasi in order to determine the fitness of the candidates to the position that we are vying for.
        Dapat yan ganoon talaga," he added.
      </p>

      <p>
        (That is ideal to determine the fitness of the candidates who are vying for that position.
        That should be the case.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Vice President Leni Robredo earlier said she was "okay" with the call for 2022 candidates to undergo drug testing.
